# Scenario 14: Systems Manager Investigation

> **Objective:** Investigate and remediate instances without opening inbound SSH or RDP.

## Scope and safety

Use this runbook only with authorized access and an assigned incident identifier. Preserve evidence before destructive changes. Commands are examples: verify the account, Region, resource identifiers, dependencies, and rollback path before execution.

## Severity guidance

- **Critical:** confirmed active compromise, root/administrator takeover, or ongoing sensitive-data loss.
- **High:** strong evidence of compromise with material exposure but no confirmed continuing impact.
- **Medium:** suspicious or noncompliant configuration requiring investigation.

## Required evidence

- Incident ID, UTC timeline, responder identity, account and Region
- Relevant CloudTrail events and configuration state
- Resource identifiers, tags, owners, dependencies, and screenshots/exports required by policy
- Every containment/remediation action and its result

## Runbook

1. Confirm the instance is managed by Systems Manager and record the agent status, instance profile, platform, and connectivity path.
2. Use Session Manager or Run Command only under an approved forensic procedure because commands may alter system state.
3. Collect process lists, listening connections, logged-in users, persistence locations, relevant logs, package history, and file hashes.
4. Send command/session logs to protected CloudWatch Logs or S3 where configured.
5. Use Inventory, Patch Manager, State Manager, or Automation for approved remediation and baseline restoration.
6. Avoid storing secrets in command parameters or shell history and restrict session access through IAM.
7. Validate the instance baseline, agent health, logging, and application operation after remediation.

## AWS CLI starting points

```bash
# Start with read-only discovery. Substitute verified identifiers and Region.
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --max-results 50
```


## Console starting points

- **CloudTrail → Event history** for recent management activity
- **CloudWatch → Logs / Metrics / Alarms** for telemetry
- Relevant service console for current configuration and dependencies
- **Systems Manager** for controlled instance access and automation where supported

## Validation and closure

- The threat is no longer active and unauthorized access has been removed.
- Required evidence is preserved and accessible only to approved responders.
- Business functionality, logging, alarms, backups, and compliance checks pass.
- Root cause, blast radius, timeline, owner, corrective actions, and follow-up dates are recorded.

## Services used

AWS Systems Manager, Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Identity and Access Management

## Exam cues

Look for explicit task verbs: **identify**, **enable**, **disable**, **isolate**, **restrict**, **snapshot**, **query**, **notify**, **remediate**, and **validate**. Complete exactly what the lab requests; avoid unrelated improvements that could consume time or break grading dependencies.
