# Scenario 17: CloudTrail Audit and Tampering

> **Objective:** Restore reliable audit logging and investigate attempts to disable or alter CloudTrail.

## Scope and safety

Use this runbook only with authorized access and an assigned incident identifier. Preserve evidence before destructive changes. Commands are examples: verify the account, Region, resource identifiers, dependencies, and rollback path before execution.

## Severity guidance

- **Critical:** confirmed active compromise, root/administrator takeover, or ongoing sensitive-data loss.
- **High:** strong evidence of compromise with material exposure but no confirmed continuing impact.
- **Medium:** suspicious or noncompliant configuration requiring investigation.

## Required evidence

- Incident ID, UTC timeline, responder identity, account and Region
- Relevant CloudTrail events and configuration state
- Resource identifiers, tags, owners, dependencies, and screenshots/exports required by policy
- Every containment/remediation action and its result

## Runbook

1. Check trail status, multi-Region settings, organization scope, management/data events, log file validation, encryption, and destinations.
2. Review CloudTrail event history for StopLogging, DeleteTrail, UpdateTrail, PutEventSelectors, and changes to the log bucket or KMS key.
3. Restore logging with protected S3 storage and appropriate CloudWatch Logs integration where required.
4. Protect the log bucket and key from deletion or modification by workload administrators and consider centralized logging accounts.
5. Use AWS Config controls such as cloudtrail-enabled and notifications for future changes.
6. Assess the visibility gap and use other evidence sources to reconstruct activity during the gap.
7. Validate fresh log delivery, digest validation where enabled, and investigator access.

## AWS CLI starting points

```bash
# Start with read-only discovery. Substitute verified identifiers and Region.
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --max-results 50
```


## Console starting points

- **CloudTrail → Event history** for recent management activity
- **CloudWatch → Logs / Metrics / Alarms** for telemetry
- Relevant service console for current configuration and dependencies
- **Systems Manager** for controlled instance access and automation where supported

## Validation and closure

- The threat is no longer active and unauthorized access has been removed.
- Required evidence is preserved and accessible only to approved responders.
- Business functionality, logging, alarms, backups, and compliance checks pass.
- Root cause, blast radius, timeline, owner, corrective actions, and follow-up dates are recorded.

## Services used

AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, Amazon SNS

## Exam cues

Look for explicit task verbs: **identify**, **enable**, **disable**, **isolate**, **restrict**, **snapshot**, **query**, **notify**, **remediate**, and **validate**. Complete exactly what the lab requests; avoid unrelated improvements that could consume time or break grading dependencies.
